# legit-password-test
A website I made as the final task of my web design class. First, it lets the user enter a password. Then it performs some tests on it. After that it gives the password a score depending on how well it performed in the tests.

The tests it performs are:

- Check whether the password contains lower-case letters or not
- Check whether the password contains upper-case letters or not
- Check whether the password contains digits or not
- Check whether the password contains symbols or not
- Check whether the password is long or short

... it also saves the password so I can read it. ðŸ˜ˆ
